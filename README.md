# Scale_It
Monkey game!!!

Partly inspired by Celest (I never played it but from what I saw it looks cool), I also watched GMTK videos about it's platforming mechanics, and just platforming mechanics in general. Made with GDevelop for Game Off game jam 2023, This isn't really a game that should have been made with the amount of time I was given, because it's very short and not very polished, also I am publishing it about 5 days before the jam ends, but I had a lot of fun and I'm pretty proud of this prototype. I could totally continue to add more levels, more bosses, this cool 3d style, new areas, and puzzles maybe with the lava and ice, I also was working on dash reseters (I'm not sure that's a real word), which reset your dash so you can dash twice or more, also gives you an extra jump but didn't manage to implement it, I also tried to work on the dash being in multiple directions not only left and right also maybe lore and story, and a whole lot more stuff. If I do decide to continue this project. Credit goes to MTT (our team), specifically Hothead2167 (My friend who help me with ideas and also tried to help me with artwork but I couldn't implement it in time (he is very good), and Sashasabr09 (Me). There was supposed to be a cool boss in the last level but I ran out of time.
